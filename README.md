# Project Name: Reversi - Andorid Game

* *Description*: Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8x8 board, 9x9, and 10x10. In 8x8, there are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelt "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players place disks on the board with their assigned colour facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's colour are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's colour is turned over to the current player's colour.
